You can also use the nginx_http_push_module from github. The benefit here is that connections will just idle along for a bit and just respond with a new move,

instead of having the client commit to a more stressfull interval polling regime. This is known as long poll.

wget http://www.nginx.org/download/nginx-0.8.53.tar.gz
tar xvfz nginx-0.8.53.tar.gz
cd nginx-0.8.53
./configure --prefix=$HOME/nginx-0.8.53 --add-module ~/src/version-control/git/nginx_http_push_module
make install


At this point you may have to edit /etc/default/nginx to add a DAEMON_OPTS="-c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf"

and edit the /etc/init.d/nginx to change DAEMON=/usr/sbin/nginx to your installed daemon path (new version) in your home directory.

You might also have to look over the /etc/init.d/nginx script to make sure it runs its config test with $DAEMON instead of nginx,

which would just use your older globally installed system binary, and thus barf on the push statements due to lacking the http_push_module.

Finally, symlink your $HOME/nginx-0.8.53/logs to point to your global /var/log/nginx area, if you have one.

(cd $HOME/nginx-0.8.53 ; mv logs logs.previous ; ln -s /var/log/nginx logs)

Here are relevant lines to add to your nginx configuration, such as your default site:

	location /ajaxtime/activity {

	  push_subscriber;

	  push_subscriber_concurrency broadcast;
          set $push_channel_id $arg_channel; #/?channel=239aff3 or some-such
          default_type  application/json;

	}

	location /ajaxtime/publish {

	   set $push_channel_id $arg_channel; #/?channel=239aff3 or some-such
	   push_publisher;

	   push_message_timeout 1h;           # expire buffered messages after 1 hour
	   push_max_message_buffer_length 100; # store absolutely at most 100 messages

	}

And in your main nginx.conf under the higher up http branch, set:

  push_max-reserved_memory 50M;
  push_authorized_channels_only off;

Finally, the ajaxtime.html needs to be tweaked to use the activity hook, instead of the prior FastCGI exclusive scheme.

Unfortunately, you need one more piece. It's invoking the fastcgi-ajaxtime binary as usual (with spawn-fcgi) but 

with the http_push_module argument following the zmq_address and zmq_port. The reason for this is to replace its

subscription thread with one which will send POST messages to the (hopefully private) /publish URL. At that point

the rest of the network can use the more efficient means of getting moves through /activity.
