establish a ZeroMQ subscription ring with zmq_forwarder (see chesstalk-0mqpubsub-module) then have the included FastCGI-ajaxtime subscribe to the out portion of it, to receive all published moved events.

There will actually just be one chess client from the chesstalk binary using the chesstalk-0mqpubsub module, publishing to it.

accept FastCGI requests that are polling for the current move data and respond with it along with the clock and other status.

binaries:

fastcgi-ajaxtime


--

sudo apt-get install libfcgi-dev

--

The instructions below are peppered with info on compiling a recent zeromq installation.

--

Prep work for fastcgi-ajaxtime:

Install zeromq-2.0.10 or better manually someplace like /home/$USER/zeromq-2.0.10
if you haven't already:

sudo apt-get install uuid-dev
tar xvfz zeromq-2.0.10.tar.gz
cd zeromq-2.0.10
mkdir zerosum
cd zerosum
../configure --prefix=$HOME/zeromq-2.0.10
make install

--

Compiling and installation of fastcgi-ajaxtime, just three steps:

# Run these commands from the fastcgi-ajaxtime directory with README and configure.ac

libtoolize
autoreconf --force --install

--

NOTE: The following instructions assume zeromq is installed in $HOME/zeromq-2.0.10
as the --prefix when that library was configured and installed.

--

Before continuing, confirm that you can pkg-config your zeromq installation:

PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/zeromq-2.0.10/lib/pkgconfig  pkg-config --libs libzmq

should return a clean response with a -L directory path and ending in -lzmq

--

mkdir decimate
cd decimate 

export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/zeromq-2.0.10/lib/pkgconfig 
../configure --prefix=$HOME/fastcgi-ajaxtime
make
make install

--

See the README.nginx-FastCGI text for configuring nginx and spawning a FastCGI process.
