Deal with a minimal form of long-polling, for example keeping a connection around for 200ms (at most)
with three spawned servers will allow for about 15 concurrent requests in the worst case, but double or 
triple that perhaps in an average case.

Outside of that, instead of a separate project to do json/epoll <-> zmq subscription processing,
can probably piggy back on the nginx_http_push_module work and include a POST submission to the /publish
concept in this distribution, and modify the web pages to query /activity to get the long-poll result.

You'd then be able to have longer 10 second, or even 20 or 30 second intervals of just hanging around.
